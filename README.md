# ML-to-Allocate-Funding
**Using ML to Allocate Funding for Development Aid**

This notebook is a that I created as a part of my MINOR PROJECT under professor Mrs. Richa Singh

This is a comprehensive notebook in which I explore many alternatives at every step of the analysis. This notebook provides a range of approaches and my interpretation of them, as opposed to a clear-cut, straight to the point notebook with an efficient solution. This has helped me learn about more tools, practice coding, and develop my analytical thinking.

**Background**

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), development aid is aid given by governments and other agencies to support the economic, environmental, social, and political development of developing countries.

Problem Statement (taken from Dataset)

HELP International have been able to raise around 10 million dollars. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively.

So, the CEO has to make decision to choose the countries that are in the direst need of aid.

Hence, the goal is to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then you need to suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most.
